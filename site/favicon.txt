<!-- This is a text placeholder for a favicon file. In a real project, you'd want to replace this with an actual favicon.ico file. -->
<!-- Because favicon.ico is a binary file, we can't create it directly through text. -->
<!-- You'll need to create a proper favicon using an image editor or online favicon generator. -->
<!-- Once created, place it in the root directory of your website. -->
