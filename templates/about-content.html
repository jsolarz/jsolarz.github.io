	<h2>Hello, World!</h2>

	<p>
		I'm <span class="highlight-2">Jonathan Solarz</span>, Hi, I'm Jonathan Solarz. I've been building software and leading tech teams
		for nearly 25 years, and I still get excited about solving real problems with smart, scalable solutions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, I'm a Software Architect at Microsoft, helping organizations across the Middle East and Africa modernize with cloud, AI, and
		thoughtful architecture. I've worked with startups and global enterprises, led projects using Azure, OpenAI, and Copilot Studio, and
		I'm always looking for ways to turn complex challenges into meaningful outcomes.
	</p>
	<p>
		What drives me most is impact—whether that's mentoring a team, streamlining a process, or helping a customer unlock new
		possibilities. I love experimenting, prototyping, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible (responsibly, of course).
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking ahead, I'm focused on shaping the future of intelligent systems—solutions that are not only technically sound but also
		human-centered, ethical, and built for real-world value. I believe the next wave of innovation will come from collaboration,
		curiosity, and a deep understanding of the people we're building for.
	</p>
	<p>If you're into building things that matter, we'll probably get along.</p>
