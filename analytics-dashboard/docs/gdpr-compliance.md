# GDPR Compliance Documentation for Analytics Dashboard

This document outlines how the analytics dashboard complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to ensure user privacy and data protection.

## 1. Data Collection

The analytics dashboard collects the following types of data:

- **Unique Visitors**: Identifies distinct users visiting the site.
- **Page Views**: Tracks the number of times pages are viewed.
- **New vs. Returning Visitors**: Differentiates between first-time visitors and those returning to the site.
- **Bounce Rate**: Measures the percentage of visitors who leave after viewing only one page.
- **Abandonment Rate**: Tracks the percentage of users who start but do not complete a specific action (e.g., filling out a form).

## 2. No Cookies Policy

To comply with GDPR, the analytics dashboard does not use cookies for tracking user data. Instead, it utilizes local storage and session storage to store necessary information temporarily without compromising user privacy.
