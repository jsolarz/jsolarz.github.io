    <h2>Hello, World!</h2>

    <p>
        I'm <span class="highlight-2">Jonathan Solarz</span>, Hi, I'm Jonathan
        Solarz. I've been building software and leading tech teams for nearly 25
        years, and I still get excited about solving real problems with smart,
        scalable solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, I'm a Software Architect at Microsoft, helping organizations
        across the Middle East and Africa modernize with cloud, AI, and
        thoughtful architecture. I've worked with startups and global
        enterprises, led projects using Azure, OpenAI, and Copilot Studio, and
        I'm always looking for ways to turn complex challenges into meaningful
        outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        What drives me most is impact—whether that's mentoring a team,
        streamlining a process, or helping a customer unlock new possibilities.
        I love experimenting, prototyping, and pushing the boundaries of what's
        possible (responsibly, of course).
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking ahead, I'm focused on shaping the future of intelligent
        systems—solutions that are not only technically sound but also
        human-centered, ethical, and built for real-world value. I believe the
        next wave of innovation will come from collaboration, curiosity, and a
        deep understanding of the people we're building for.
    </p>
    <p>If you're into building things that matter, we'll probably get along.</p>
